                <strong>Bribery and corruption prevention</strong>

                  Jasonl, is dedicated to eliminating bribery and corruption
                  within our supply chain. We actively seek compliance
                  statements from our suppliers, extending to two tiers, and
                  implement comprehensive staff policies and training programs
                  to uphold integrity across our organization.

                <strong> Supply chain compliance measures </strong>
                <p>
                  Our commitment extends to surveying both local and
                  international major suppliers, requesting them to do the same
                  with their top suppliers. To facilitate clear communication,
                  our compliance survey documents are available in multiple
                  languages, including Mandarin.

                <strong> Human and labour rights assurance </strong>
                <p>
                  We strive to verify that all employees within our supply
                  chain, up to two tiers, have the fundamental rights to choose
                  their employer, work in safe conditions, receive fair
                  compensation, enjoy unrestricted movement, and are not
                  subjected to child labor.

                <strong> Dynamic supply chain monitoring </strong>
                <p>
                  Our supply chain monitoring is an evolving process. As our
                  supply chain expands, we remain vigilant in verifying
                  compliance with Human Rights and Anti-Corruption legislation.
                  We measure our progress against global standards such as the
                  Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals.
